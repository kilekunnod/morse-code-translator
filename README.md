Morse Code Translator

This project is a simple yet effective Morse code translator built with C, designed to convert text input into Morse code using an Arduino-based setup. The translator takes user input and displays the corresponding Morse code on an LCD screen. The project uses an LED to visually represent the dots and dashes of Morse code.

Features:
Text to Morse Code: Converts text input into Morse code.
LCD Display: Displays the translated Morse code on an LCD.
LED Representation: Uses an LED to show the on-off pattern for Morse code (dots and dashes).
Compact and Efficient: Designed to run on an Arduino platform with minimal hardware.

Requirements:
Arduino IDE
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
LCD Display
LED

How to Use: 
Enter the desired text to be translated into Morse code.
The translated Morse code will appear on the LCD screen.
The LED will blink the corresponding Morse code pattern (dot for short blink, dash for longer blink).

Installation:
Clone or download the repository and open the code in the Arduino IDE. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board and connect the LCD and LED components as per the circuit diagram.
